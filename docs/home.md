#  JustReadIT

JustReadIT is a text recognition tool developed as part of EPITA's 3rd semester project. 
The project specifications can be found [here](documents.md#specifications).

This software allows you to extract a text from an image. It has 4 processes allowing a better use :

- See the steps for decomposing and reading the image.

- Find the right angle to rotate the image to put it in the right angle.

- Removes the background from an image to make the text more readable.

- Saves the letters of the text separately to be able to start learning the neural network.
